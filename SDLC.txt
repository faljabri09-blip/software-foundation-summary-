SDLC

SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a process used to plan, create, test, and maintain software in a structured and efficient manner.
It is a framework that helps teams produce high-quality software that meets user requirements, is delivered on time and within budget, and can
be maintained and enhanced over time. Key phases typically include requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Key phases of the SDLC
Planning and Requirement Analysis: Gathering and analyzing the project's requirements to define the scope and plan the development.
Design: Creating a detailed design, including architecture and user interface, based on the requirements.
Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code according to the design specifications.
Testing: Verifying that the software works as expected by finding and fixing bugs.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment so users can access it.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates to the software after it has been deployed, which can include fixing new bugs or adding new features.
