Agile 

Agile is an approach to project management that centres around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects. The incremental parts of
a project are carried out in short-term development cycles. The approach prioritises quick delivery, adapting to change, and collaboration
rather than top-down management and following a set plan. In Agile processes, there is constant feedback, allowing for team members to adjust 
to challenges as they arise and for stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, 
the Agile approach is now widely used to execute many different types of projects and run organisations. Contrast this with more traditional
forms of project management. Traditional project management generally progresses linearly. Moving from planning, designing, implementation and 
closing stages happen after the previous stage is complete. 

Sprint 

a short, high-speed burst of activity, most commonly referring to a short-distance running race in athletics. However, the term is also used in 
project management to describe a short, time-boxed period of work (in the Scrum methodology) and in motorsports to denote a timed race on 
a circuit.
