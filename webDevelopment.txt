Front-end web development focuses on the user-facing side of websites and web applications. It involves creating everything users see and
interact with in their browser, ensuring a visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive experience.


Web development's backend refers to the server-side of a website or application, handling all the unseen processes like managing the database, 
application logic, and user authentication. It processes requests from the user's browser (the frontend), sends data back for display, and 
ensures the application runs correctly and securely. Key responsibilities include building and managing servers, databases, and APIs 
(Application Programming Interfaces).


Databases are fundamental components of web development, serving as organized storage systems for all the data a web application needs to 
function. This includes user information, content, product details, transaction records, and more.
