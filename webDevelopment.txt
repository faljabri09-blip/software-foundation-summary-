Front-end web development focuses on the user-facing side of websites and web applications. It involves creating everything users see and
interact with in their browser, ensuring a visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive experience.


Web development's backend refers to the server-side of a website or application, handling all the unseen processes like managing the database, 
application logic, and user authentication. It processes requests from the user's browser (the frontend), sends data back for display, and 
ensures the application runs correctly and securely. Key responsibilities include building and managing servers, databases, and APIs 
(Application Programming Interfaces).


Databases are fundamental components of web development, serving as organized storage systems for all the data a web application needs to 
function. This includes user information, content, product details, transaction records, and more. 


The provided list outlines key components of the .NET stack, particularly relevant for full-stack web development:
C#: This is the primary programming language for the .NET platform. It is a modern, object-oriented language used for building a wide range of 
applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and cloud services.

EF Core (Entity Framework Core): This is an open-source, cross-platform object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET. It allows developers to 
interact with databases using C# objects, eliminating the need to write raw SQL queries for many common data operations. EF Core handles tasks 
like mapping C# classes to database tables, generating SQL queries, and managing database migrations.

LINQ (Language Integrated Query): This is a powerful feature of C# that provides a unified way to query data from various sources, including 
collections, databases (via EF Core), XML, and more. LINQ allows developers to write expressive, type-safe queries directly within their C# code,
improving readability and maintainability.

Blazor: This is a .NET web framework for building interactive client-side web UI with C#. Blazor allows developers to create rich, interactive 
web applications using C# instead of JavaScript, enabling full-stack web development within the .NET ecosystem. Blazor can run on the 
client-side in the browser (Blazor WebAssembly) or on the server (Blazor Server). 


Comparison C#, java and Python 
C# and Java: Both are statically-typed, object-oriented languages with C-style syntax using braces for code blocks. They are compiled to an 
intermediate bytecode (Common Language Runtime for C#, Java Virtual Machine for Java) which is then executed.

Python: Dynamically-typed and supports multiple paradigms (object-oriented, imperative, functional). It utilizes indentation for code blocks, 
emphasizing readability and a simpler syntax.
